The instruction you've provided doesn't seem to apply to the code file contents. The given 'before' and 'after' examples in the instruction are the same. They both show a setTimeout function with two state updates inside which should result in two re-renders in React due to non-batching. 

However, in your code file, there is no similar setTimeout function with multiple state updates that would cause multiple re-renders. Therefore, this instruction does not result in any changes to your code file.

If you have a specific part of the code that you'd like to be modified to use batching, please specify that part. Currently, the instruction provided does not apply to the given code file.
